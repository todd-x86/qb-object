QB Object
========

QB Object is a GUI library for QuickBASIC 4.5 for MS-DOS.

I built QB Object back in 2005-2006 as a way to develop GUI applications quickly and easily with optimal functionality that was often missed when developing GUIs from scratch.

Using [DOSBox](http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/) would be best for testing your MS-DOS applications built with QB Object.  For those of you enthusiasts out there, the following are required of your environment to run QB Object applications:
* 640x480 VGA (16-color) resolution
* QuickBASIC 4.5 (haven't tested with 7.1)
* 640 KB RAM
* A few MB of space...
* Oh, and of course, MS-DOS
